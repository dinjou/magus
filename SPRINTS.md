## Velocity Estimates

**MVP (Sprints 0-11):** 70-90 story points ‚âà 70-90 hours ‚âà 9-11 full work days

**With Stretch Goals:** +20-30 hours

**Realistic Timeline:**
- **MVP in 2-3 intense days:** Possible if working 12-16 hour days, skipping some polish
- **MVP in 5-7 comfortable days:** More realistic pace with breaks and polish
- **Full implementation with stretch goals:** 10-12 days total

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers & Solutions

**Risk:** React + TypeScript learning curve  
**Solution:** Start with JavaScript, migrate to TypeScript later; use templates

**Risk:** Docker networking issues  
**Solution:** Use docker-compose which handles networking; thorough documentation

**Risk:** PWA installation issues on iOS  
**Solution:** Test early; document iOS-specific quirks; have fallback (just use browser)

**Risk:** Email sending failing in production  
**Solution:** Test SMTP configuration early; provide multiple provider examples

**Risk:** Scope creep (feature requests)  
**Solution:** Stick to MVP first; maintain backlog for future iterations

**Risk:** Data migration from old system  
**Solution:** Write and test migration script; keep old system running during transition
